# Sigma.js - Utils

This package contains various utils functions to ease the use of [sigma.js](https://www.sigmajs.org/), and expose some code snippets that are very useful, but are not important and complex enough to deserve their own package.

### `fitViewportToNodes` and `getCameraStateToFitViewportToNodes`

These functions allow moving a sigma instance's camera so that it fits to a given group of nodes.

### `getNodesInViewport`

This function allows retrieving the list of nodes that are visible (even partially) in the current viewport.
